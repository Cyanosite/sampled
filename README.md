# Forward

The universal music player.

## Rationale

Coming soon...

Forward is highly inspired by the [Meta music tag editor][meta] and [Doppler music player][doppler].

## Use

> [!NOTE]
>
> Forward is in development and has limited feature support. Audio playback, for example, is currently unavailable (you
> can browse metadata, however).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Forward has not been notarized by Apple. To run the app, open the app and [follow these instructions][apple-notarization-bypass].

You can either download a release of the app from the [Releases][releases] page or build the project from source in Xcode.

macOS Sequoia (15) or later is required.

### Install

The first time you build the project (as well as make changes to configuration, like building for release), it will take
a significant amount of time to complete.[^1] This is due to the project depending on FFmpeg and libopus.
Subsequent builds should perform much better.

1. Clone the Git repository (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/kyleerhabor/forward Forward`)
2. Open the Xcode project (e.g. `open Forward/Forward.xcodeproj`)
3. Select `Product > Archive` to build the project for release
4. From the Organizer, select `Distribute App > Custom > Copy App` to export the app
5. Open the app
